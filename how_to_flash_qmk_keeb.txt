* Set up qmk on linux

* Use qmk config to set default keyboard and layout

# Notes
* "Keyboards" refer to the physical device, the actual physical layout of the keys, e.g. ergodox, dactyl manuform, iris, corne, etc.

* "Key map" refers to which letters and symbols are mapped to which keys. 

* Go to the qmk configurator online and set up your keymap the way you want.

* Download the json file corresponding to your keymap, e.g. handwired/dactyl_manuform/5x6

* Move the json file to the folder of the keyboard you're using in the qmk_firmware directory, e.g. handwired/dactyl_manuform/5x6


* Navigate to the top directory of qmk_firmware

* run "qmk compile <path to json file>"

* copy the hex file over to the keyboards directory, e.g. handwired/dactyl_manuform/5x5/  (Not sure if this step is necessary)

* Run the following command:

make handwired/dactyl_manuform/5x6:atreus44_rev4:flash
